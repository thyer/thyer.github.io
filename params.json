{"name":"Trent Hyer | Software Engineer","tagline":"","body":"## Trent Hyer\r\nI'm a software engineer who's passionate about linguistics and data science. Alma matter: [BYU (Provo)](https://cs.byu.edu/)\r\n\r\n#### Natural Languages\r\nLearning new things about culture through languages and food is one of my favorite things. I speak most of the official languages of Western Europe and the Americas. I am especially interested in collaborating with developers/programmers not based in the United States, and in their native language. Software engineering is as much a human process as it is a computational process. \r\n\r\n#### Featured projects\r\n* **[Calliope Sentiment Parser Series](http://calliopesps.github.io/):** An undertaking in statistical methods for opinion mining. Source code, publications, and documentation available at the site page. \r\n* **[Artificial Intelligence Tanks](https://github.com/thyer/CS470):** Class project for BYU's AI course (CS470). Allows simulated tanks to traverse obstacles, map out unknown worlds, and predict motion of enemy tanks.\r\n* **[Apollo](http://thyer.github.io/Apollo/):** Content recommendation engine built to mine articles for relevant topics and display them to the user. Although the fully developed code is proprietary, the initial demonstration is still available to the public. \r\n* **[Ticket to Ride](https://github.com/bmcgary/TicketToRide):** Web version of the classic board game Ticket to Ride. Developed as a class project for BYU's Software Engineering course (CS428) upon special request from faculty members who wished to use the game as the new course project for CS340.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
