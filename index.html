<p>I'm a software engineer who's passionate about linguistics and data science. Alma matter: Brigham Young University (Provo, UT). </p>

<a id="natural-languages" class="anchor" href="#natural-languages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Natural Languages</h4>

<p>Learning new things about culture through languages and food is one of my favorite things. I speak most of the official languages of Western Europe and the Americas. I am especially interested in collaborating with developers/programmers not based in the United States, and in their native language. Software engineering is as much a human process as it is a computational process. </p>
