<p>I'm a software engineer who's passionate about linguistics and data science. Alma matter: <a href="https://cs.byu.edu/">BYU (Provo)</a></p>

<p>Learning new things about culture through languages and food is one of my favorite things. I speak most of the official languages of Western Europe and the Americas. I am especially interested in collaborating with developers/programmers not based in the United States, and in their native language. Software engineering is as much a human process as it is a computational process. </p>
